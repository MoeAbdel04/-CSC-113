Starting a Task from Scratch with a LLM
You can "bootstrap" your situation the way you with other topics -- find someone who understands the problem better than you do, and get them to explain it to you.
You can generally start any new task like this (and as you modify and tweak this process, write it down and share it, along with your prompts!)
Ask a LLM to explain the problem in general terms. (If it's overly technical, you can go again with changes like "explain like i'm five" or "explain like I'm a high school student".
Ask the model to come up with a general plan of action
Take a few of the points from the plan of action (like the first few), and ask the model to explain how to accomplish them.
Will this always work? No. It's possible for LLMs to get "stuck" on certain parts of a problem.
And remember, because conversations are limited length, when things are getting too long:
Ask the model to summarize the conversation so far, then
Start a new conversation by leading with that summary, and something like "Let's continue to solve this problem."
